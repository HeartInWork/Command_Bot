# Command_Bot
A robust discord bot. 

Commands (As convention start with ! prefix):  
!help -> List all the available commands and their descriptions.  
!info -> Takes the first @mention server member and displays their info in a rich embed.  
!ping -> Calculates the ping between sending a message and editing, giving a round-trip latency value.  
!userinfo -> Displays your own Discord information.
